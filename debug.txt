    proposed fixes:
        1. make sure distance between rectangles is right and not zero!

////FIX u_move FOR EACH AS MULTIPLIER

solved:
    lines:
        33 (only with 39) : unit.cpp
        39 : unit.cpp
    hypothesis:
        std::vector<SDL_Rect> u_sold_rect is not properly initialised at:
            resized (33)
            or
            assigned value (39)
    proposed fixes:
        1: intialised under constructor intialiser list : worked?
