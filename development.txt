TO DO:
done. Implement 2nd player functionality by means of two Army class instantiations
    . Implement user interface
    done - Fix user input issue for main_menu test proejct
        done - Have button class generate a text texture pointer at instantiation from Text struct info: then simply rendercopy
        - implement full main_menu fselect interface
        done - fix initialisation isssues for std::vector / std::array
        done - overload copy assignment operator for button class using current initialisation implementation
                    - //no need, use default copy constructor
    done    - initialise units with initial positions from position indexation and fgrid parameters in unit constructor rather than field constructor
     
    . Implement game dynamics
        - implement move commands through selection, move check, enable commands, receive commands
            - move(bool *mvan_ongoing) {
                mvan_ongoing = true;
                mv(mv_seg)
                static int d_covered += mv_seg;
                if (d_covered == this->move) { mvan_ongoing = false }
            }
        - implement attack commands (selection, check (distance) - enable command, receive command)
            - health handling and display
        - end game conditions
        - figure out resizing functionality to test interface
        - continuous resizing won't work, rather work with the current dynamic framework to provide a selection of window dimensions
        - implement aselect interface
            - position input functionality
        - generate field + armies from user input
    .Add Wizard Division + spells - as attacks
    . Polish game mechanics and display
        - unit numbers + composition rules : soldier cost?
        - unit moves (maybe choice of advance < max?) + attacks + damages + health
        - unit attack effectiveness
    . User interface
        - dynamic window size
        - interactive display
            - translucid rectangles over units
            - unit division information and health
            - move and attack preview
        - user input through screen
            *selection->command
            - main menu
                - field choice
                - army choice
                - quit, restart, resume
                - scrolling translucid displays
            - move commands from screen
    . Implement save_match_state + save_army_config + save_game_config
    . Implement computer bot
    . Implement online multiplayer
    . Debugging + Polishing
    . Target Build
    . Release on Steam for MacOS, Windows and Linux
    . Work on Swift for IOs, Android and Google Phone
